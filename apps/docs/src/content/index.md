## What is this?

Editable is an editor framework that works without relying on the native property "contenteditable".

- Use slatejs to manage all data models, all slatejs features and apis also apply to it.
- All Selections are completely drawn by Editable, so you don't need to pay attention to the differences in the performance of Selections on different platforms. You can even define the style and graphics drawn by Selection yourself.
